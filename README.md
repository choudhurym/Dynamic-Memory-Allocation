# Dynamic-Memory-Allocation
This project is a good example of practicing dynamic memory allocation. For this project I used the scanf() function instead of using radInt() that I used in my previous projects. One can read in integers from the command prompt. The program will be reading in two sorted arrays. The very first integer it reads in will be the length of the first list. Let's call it length1. The second integer will be the length of the second list. Let's call it length2. The next length1 integers will be the values in the first list and the following length2 integers will be the values in the second list. We can assume that the two lists are both sorted. Lastly, you will need to store these sorted lists in integer arrays, and then allocate an integer array with length length1 + length2 to store the merged result.
